Line is printing when is "/n" met that is why we have 2 different cases:

1. Result: 
Hello
Hello

    fork() copy entire snapshot includes unprinted "Hello" in stoud.
    Then we add "/n" in print that is why we have 2 lines.
2.  Result:
Hello



We have "\n" before fork() that why when fork() stout is empty,  we have only \n.
