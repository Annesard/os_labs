A machine has 16-bit virtual addresses.
Pages are 8 KB. How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table? Explain your computations.

Each page is 8kb = 2^13

2^16/2^13 = 2^3 = 8
Page table requires you to have 8 entries.

The upper 3 bits could specify one of the 8 virtual pages and the lower 5 bits would then specify the byte offset (0 to 32) within the selected page.
