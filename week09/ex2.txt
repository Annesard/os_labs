n order to increase Hit/Miss ratio we should increase amount of non unique keys in our inputs. Consequently, when the amount of unique keys approach to the size of our frame our ratio decrease. 

Let's assume that n is the size of our frame. Arithmetic progression of 1 to n will be the best case because numbers dont repeat. 

One of the worst cases could be just repetitive numbers 1,1, 1, .., 1 n times.
